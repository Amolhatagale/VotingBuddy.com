        <p>An online voting system is a software platform that allows groups to securely conduct votes. High-quality
            online voting systems
            balance ballot security, accessibility, and the overall requirements of an organization's voting
            event.<br><br>
            At their core, online voting systems protect the integrity of your vote by preventing voters from being able
            to vote multiple times.
            As a digital platform, they eliminate the need to gather in-person, cast votes using paper, or by any other
            means
            (e.g. email, insecure survey software).<br><br>
            You may hear an online voting system being referred to as an online e- voting system, or electronic voting.
            These all make reference to the same thing: a secure voting tool that allows your group to collect input
            from your group
            and closely scrutinize the results in real time.<br><br><br><br>
